### Theory 
<h5>Smart Contracts</h5>
A smart contract is a self-executing program stored on a blockchain that automatically carries out actions based on predefined rules. It eliminates the need for intermediaries by ensuring trust, security, and transparency through a tamper-proof, decentralized ledger.

<h5>How Smart Contracts Work</h5>
<p>Smart contracts are like digital agreements that run on a blockchain. They follow a clear process to handle tasks like transferring money or verifying deals without a middleman:</p>

<p>Step 1: People decide the rules for the smart contract, such as "send money when a task is done."</p>
<p>Step 2: Developers write these rules into a program using a special coding language.</p>
<p>Step 3: The program is tested to make sure it works correctly and securely.</p>
<p>Step 4: Once ready, the smart contract is placed on a blockchain, where it canâ€™t be changed.</p>
<p>Step 5: The smart contract waits for a trigger, like a payment or a message from a trusted source called an "oracle."</p>
<p>Step 6: When the conditions are met, the smart contract runs automatically, and the blockchain updates with the result like transferring money from one user to another.</p>

<p>This process ensures that actions happen exactly as planned, with all computers on the blockchain agreeing on the outcome, making it fast, safe, and reliable.</p>
