<h5>Smart Contract</h5>


A smart contract is a computer program or a transaction protocol that is intended to automatically execute, control or document events and actions according to the terms of a contract or an agreement. Smart contracts are typically stored on a blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that is secure and tamper-proof.
